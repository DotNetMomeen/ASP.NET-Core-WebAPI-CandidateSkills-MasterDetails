<h1>ðŸ“‹ ASP.NET Core Web API for Candidate & Skills Management</h1>

<p>This project is an ASP.NET Core Web API designed to efficiently manage candidates and their associated skills using a master-detail relationship. It provides a complete solution for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on candidates, while also allowing the addition of multiple skills for each candidate. The API is simple, robust, and scalable, making it an ideal choice for managing candidate skill sets.</p>

<h2>ðŸ›  Technologies</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ASP.NET Core Web API:</strong> The main framework for developing API endpoints and business logic.</li>
  <li><strong>Entity Framework Core:</strong> Used for managing database operations, relationships, and ensuring data integrity.</li>
  <li><strong>SQL Server:</strong> Serves as the backend for storing candidate and skill data.</li>
  <li><strong>C#:</strong> The programming language behind the business logic and API.</li>
  <li><strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript:</strong> Can be integrated with any front-end framework for a complete full-stack solution.</li>
  <li><strong>File Upload:</strong> Utilizes server-side storage for candidate images with options for uploading and updating the profile image.</li>
